I'm pretending to be a Stats60 student. You should
see

     ""82##Test: Student Andreas sending to RoboTA""

of words so we'll see whether this gets back to the

I'll send to Lucas in a moment.

this is a second msg. This time I'm sending as
a different student than last time. This msg is
sent to stats60ta, rather than to robota.

The subject line should be something like:

    nm##Sending now as a different student to Lucas

where nm is something other than 82.

Is that what you see?

this exchange was very useful: it exposed that your

Hopefully before she leaves tomorrow.

I may lean on your patience and repeat the experiment

Dear whatever, I will send five
message now. I found the problem we had.
The CS mail server is willing to process
messages with a FROM at ...@cs.stanford.edu,
but not at ...@stanford.edu. That's to avoid
mail server takeovers.

Do different things with these five. I added a
very short reason for any warning msgs
right in the subject line.

The relay now only decides that you accidentally
signed if it literally finds ""Best, Lucas"" in the msg.
It used to look for just Lucas. That seemed too
broad.

Hi Sarah,


Thanks for your email, let's see if this helps:


First, when we talk about getting ""exactly a certain number of outcomes"", w=
e seem to be asking a question about the sum of draws. Since the central li=
mit theorem applies to the sum of draws, we can approximate the distributio=
n of the sum of draws by a normal distribution. Since the normal distributi=
on is continuous, and thus puts zero probability on any single exact outcom=
e, we must use a further approximation to find the the probability of exact=
ly a certain number of outcomes. This last approximation uses the 0.5 rule-=
-that is, if the number of interest is N, then you would compute the probab=
ility under the normal curve of getting less than N+0.5, and subtract the p=
robability under the normal curve of getting less than N-0.5.


I hope that answers your question!

Hi Amit,


You're very close, there's just one thing you're missing: the 0.5 rule. Sin=

Hi Alexis,


Your answer is incorrect, but you've made a very legitimate and common mist=
ake--you forgot to use the 0.5 rule. Note that the question is asking for t=
he probability of ""fewer than 90  3's"", which is the same as ""fewer than or=
 equal to 89  3's"", since you can't have a decimal number of 3's. However, =
in the normal approximation, you can have a decimal outcome, so we need to =
be careful, and the correction learned in class is to use 89.5 instead of 9=
0 in the computation--in some sense splitting the difference.


Hope that helps, and that you didn't waste too much time rechecking your an=
swer (your answer would be correct if it weren't for the 0.5 correction).

You are doing both problems correctly, but be careful with rounding. Both p=

Hi Lucas,

I keep getting hung up on problem 6, but I'm not sure why because it's a
lot like other problems on the pset. Here's my reasoning:

a) Expected val =3D 1600, SE =3D 44.72

z =3D (1600-1500.5)/44.72 =3D 2.21 =3D> A =3D 97.22 =3D>
P =3D .5 + .9722/2 =3D .9861

a) Expected val =3D 100, SE =3D 8.66

z =3D (100-89.5)/8.66 =3D 1.21 =3D> A =3D 76.99 =3D>
P =3D .5 - .7699/2 =3D .115

However, when I try to enter these values, they get marked wrong. Any idea
where I'm going wrong in my reasoning, or is this another bug in the HW?

Thanks,
Eleanor

Hi Alexis,


You're very close, but just be careful with rounding. We were a bit strict =
on the allowable range for this problem--as a rule, I would recommend keepi=

Thank you for your help! But unfortunately, it still seems wrong. I used
89.5 as my observed value, 100 as my expected value (average) and 8.66 as
my SE. This gave me a Z value of 1.21. This in turn gave me an area of
76.99%.
(100-76.99)/2 gave me 11.505, or a probability of 0.11505. This is still
marked wrong. Is there something else I am missing?

Many thanks for your help,

Alexis

Hi Royce,


Those answers are very close, just be careful with rounding. As a general r=

Hope this email finds you well! I'm currently working on the STATS60 Pset
and I'm really stuck on questions 4 and 5.

For question 4 parts A and B, I thought that the ""net gain"" would be the
same as the expected sum of 100 draws from a box with a 12/38 chance of
getting a +2 and a 26/38 chance of getting a -1. When I calculated the
average of the box, I got -0.053. To get the expected net gain, I then
multiplied this box average by the number of draws (100) to get -5.3. I
have tried this problem many different ways but still can't figure out why
this is incorrect and was wondering if I am not understanding something
correctly?

For question 5 part A, I wasn't sure how we are supposed to use normal
approximation to calculate the odds of getting exactly 17 heads, as all of
the examples we have discussed in class using normal approximation with
probability have revolved around getting ""at least X result"". However, I
don't know how we can calculate this probability without using the binomial
formula and was hoping you could possibly point me in the right direction?

Hi Angela,


For 4 A and B, you're doing the problem correctly, it's just a rounding err=
or (this problem has a somewhat unusually narrow allowable range). In gener=
al, for intermediate calculations, it is good to always keep 3 significant =
digits (which would give -0.0526) or 3 decimal places (which you did), whic=
hever gives higher precision.


For 5 A, note that getting ""exactly 17 heads"" is the same as getting ""at le=
ast 17 heads"" and (NOT ""at least 18 heads"")--both of which look like things=
 discussed in class.

I have a question on Question 7c of the homework, which asks how many =
people we=E2=80=99d need to include in our SRS in order for the 95% =
confidence interval to have a margin of error or + or - 1%.

First, I determined that:

(1.96) * (100) * sqrt [p * (1-p)] / sqrt [n] =3D 1

Therefore, if we bring the constants over to the right side of the =
equation, we get:

sqrt [p * (1-p)] / sqrt [n] =3D .0051

Then, we square both sides to get:

[p * (1-p)] / n =3D 2.603 * 10^-5

We know that p is .71, so [p * (1-p)] =3D [.71 * .29] =3D .2059.

.2059 / n =3D 2.603 * 10^-5

.2059 =3D 2.603 * 10^-5 * n

n =3D 7909.8544


Therefore, I concluded that we=E2=80=99d need to sample 7910 in order to =
have a + or - 1% margin of error. I=E2=80=99ve tried plugging this =
answer into the homework site, but it says that this is the wrong =

Hi Sarah,


I'm not sure I understand your question about 3c--it just asks about the SD=
 of the box, so if you've already computed the box SD, then just answer T/F=
 whether it's 20,000 or not. Perhaps you meant to ask about a different que=

For #6, remember that ""how much an estimate is off by"" corresponds to the S=
E of the estimate.


Hope that helps!

Hi Sarah,


Sure, for 3e, you want to use the CLT to approximate the fraction of the 90=
0 forms chosen for audit which have incomes over $50,000. That is, you need=
 the EV and SE for the aforementioned fraction, computed using the box mode=
l described in 3a-d. Once you have those, compute the Z scores correspondin=
g to 0.19 and 0.21 and look up the area between them in your Z table.

We know that p is .71, so [p * (1-p)] =3D [.71 * .29] =3D .2059.

.2059 / n =3D 2.603 * 10^-5

.2059 =3D 2.603 * 10^-5 * n

n =3D 7909.8544


Therefore, I concluded that we'd need to sample 7910 in order to have a + o=
r - 1% margin of error. I've tried plugging this answer into the homework s=
ite, but it says that this is the wrong answer. Could you please explain wh=
at I'm doing wrong?

Hi TA,

I have a question on Question 7c of the homework, which asks how many peopl=
e we'd need to include in our SRS in order for the 95% confidence interval =
to have a margin of error or + or - 1%.

First, I determined that:

(1.96) * (100) * sqrt [p * (1-p)] / sqrt [n] =3D 1

Therefore, if we bring the constants over to the right side of the equation=
, we get:

sqrt [p * (1-p)] / sqrt [n] =3D .0051

Then, we square both sides to get:

[p * (1-p)] / n =3D 2.603 * 10^-5

We know that p is .71, so [p * (1-p)] =3D [.71 * .29] =3D .2059.

.2059 / n =3D 2.603 * 10^-5
