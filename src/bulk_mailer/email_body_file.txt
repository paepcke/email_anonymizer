Hi,

thank you for working through my networking class. I hope you are
learning what you need.

Two colleagues of mine, Andreas Paepcke and Mike Baiocchi are
investigating possible future methods for providing more individual
support for Stanford's large MOOCs. They are looking for participants
in a six-week experiment around that theme.

If you participate, you will be able to email questions that arise as
you work on the course problems and quizzes. Your emails will go to
Stanford. For the duration of the experiment your technical questions
will be answered by return email.

Your participation could help us and others learn about how
universities can improve their MOOCs. Of course, if you decide not to
participate, nothing at all will change in your experience of the
course going forward.

To participate, please reply to this email, just briefly stating your
willingness.

Best regards, and best of success as you continue the class.

Phil
